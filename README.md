# C
All C programs done at Sister Nivedita University.

To run the codes you can use any IDE, but I would suggest to fork the total directory and open it as a folder in Visual Studio Code.

The Programs that you will find here are such as follows:
1.Print "Hello World"
2.Print "\n" new line feed and "\t" tab space.
3.Centigrade and Fahrenheit conversion.(Switch Case)
4.Find the sum of two different numbers.
5.Find the sum of first 'n' natural numbers.
6.Find largest of three numbers entered by the user.
